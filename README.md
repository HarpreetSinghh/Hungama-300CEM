## History

This application was submitted by Harpreet Singh as the Third year Project to compete the module 300CEM (Android Development)

## Criteria 

The app design checks off the following requirements that were demanded by the 300CEM project:

## User Interface/Layout/Design

•	Movies are displayed in the main layout via a list view

•	UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie

•	Movie Details layout contains title, rating, movie cast images, videos, and review amount.

•	The user is presented with a login screen where they can login with desi hungama or with Facebook to view the movies.


•	Loads up with sound and animation when the app is started.

•	Get movie notifications on the phone and wearable daily. 

## Data Persistence

•	App saves all the movies in a database when closing an app and re-opening it. 

•	When the ‘refresh’ option is selected from the action bar, the main view displays the entire movies collection based on movie IDs stored in a database.

•	When user has logged in with Facebook and when the application is closed by the user and re-opened, the Facebook login is still there so they do not need to log in again; only if they logged out by clicking on the button.



## Hardware and sensors

•	When the application is opened, it shows a animation with the sound. The duration of the animation lasts 3 seconds.

•	Get movie notifications on the phone and wearable daily by putting the ‘time’ and ‘second’ for each day. 

## Version Control and Testing

•	Evidence of regular commits over an extended period of time, together with a range of tests showing how they contribute to code quality.

## Picasso library 

Picasso library took all the work out of downloading and inserting images for the Desi Hungama application into the movies database.
